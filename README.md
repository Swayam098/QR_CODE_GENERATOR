This project is a simple Python-based QR Code Generator that allows users to input a website URL and generate a QR code, which is then saved as a PNG image. It's an easy-to-use utility for creating scannable QR codes for sharing URLs or other data quickly and efficiently.

Features:
Input URL: Users can input a website URL via the command line.
Custom QR Code Generation: The QR code is customizable in terms of size, error correction, and other parameters, ensuring flexibility and reliability.
PNG Output: The generated QR code is saved as a PNG image in the local directory (or specified location).

How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python library:

pip install qrcode[pil]
Run the Python script:

python qr_code_generator.py
When prompted, input the website URL you want to convert into a QR code.
The QR code will be saved as website_qrcode.png in the project directory or a specified folder.
